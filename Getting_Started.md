# Getting Started 
Once you have your Cargill **ID** and **password** and citrix receiver downloaded, refer the Remote_Access_Anywhere_End_User PDF documentation, its time to raise some access requests for the necessary utilities

login to your [Cargill Site] (https://remoteaccess.anywhere.cargill.com/Citrix/ExternalAccessWeb/) , after a sucessfull login  select a DESKTOP from the desktop's tap 
> The desktop can be any of your choice, the one that works for you; I prefer MSUSELKG607 Support Desktop.
Run the downloaded citrix client, If for any reason it fails for you try running a different desktop.
